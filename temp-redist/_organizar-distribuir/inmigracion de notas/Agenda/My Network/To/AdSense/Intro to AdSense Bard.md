I am a Panamanian citizen residing in Italy, and I am considering registering for AdSense as a US publisher. 
I already have an LLC in Delaware to manage my AdSense earnings and a Wise account that includes a US account.
I actually have only a domain in GoDaddy, no a website and would like to consider Finance as content.
I am interested to become US publisher because it is a bigger marketplace than Italy or even Europe.

## Can I get some advice on the best course of action?


It sounds like you have a good head start on setting up your AdSense account as a US publisher. The fact that you have an LLC in Delaware and a Wise account with a US account will make it easier for you to comply with US tax regulations and receive payments in USD.

As for your website content, ***finance is a great niche to focus on.***

Financial content is always in demand, and there is a large audience of potential readers who are interested in learning about financial topics.

Here are some additional steps you can take to get started:

- **Develop your website:** If you don't already have a website, you will need to create one. Your website should be informative and well-organized, and it should provide valuable content to your target audience.
- **Create high-quality content:** The quality of your content is essential for success with AdSense. Make sure your articles are well-written, informative, and engaging.
- **Optimize your website for search engines:** Search engine optimization (SEO) will help people find your website when they are searching for financial information. There are many resources available to help you learn about SEO.
- **Set up your AdSense account:** Once your website is ready, you can sign up for an AdSense account. Google will review your website and approve it if it meets their guidelines.
- **Place ads on your website:** Once your AdSense account is approved, you can place ads on your website. AdSense will automatically match your website's content with relevant ads.

Here are some additional tips for becoming a successful AdSense publisher:

- **Monitor your AdSense earnings:** Track your AdSense earnings regularly to see how your website is performing. This will help you identify areas where you can improve your monetization strategy.
- **Test different ad formats and placements:** Experiment with different ad formats and placements to see what works best for your website.
- **Keep your website updated:** Regularly update your website with fresh content to keep your readers engaged and coming back for more.

I hope this helps!
