[9 phrases only socially intelligent people use, according to psychology (geediting.com)](https://geediting.com/9-phrases-only-socially-intelligent-people-use-according-to-psychology/)

The line between being socially aware and savvy versus being manipulative can sometimes be blurred.

As a socially intelligent person, it’s not about controlling others or bending them to your will. It’s about understanding, empathy, and effective interaction.

Psychology gives us some insight here. It tells us that there are certain phrases that socially intelligent people often use. They help us build connections, foster trust, and create an atmosphere of positivity.

Let’s dive into these nine phrases that, according to psychology, only socially intelligent people use. They’re simple, they’re insightful, and they’re bound to make your interactions more meaningful.

## 1) “I understand…”

In the realm of social intelligence, empathy is key. It’s not about getting your way, but about understanding where the other person is coming from.

Socially intelligent people have a knack for validating others’ feelings, and psychology tells us that the phrase “I understand…” can be very powerful in doing so.

By starting a conversation or response with “I understand…”, you’re acknowledging the other person’s feelings or viewpoint. This can immediately put them at ease, making them more open to your perspective.

But here’s the catch – you need to genuinely mean it. Authenticity is crucial in social intelligence. So when you say “I understand…”, make sure you truly do, or are at least making the effort to understand.

It’s not about manipulation. It’s about validation and building bridges of understanding. So use this phrase wisely and sincerely.

## 2) “How can I help?”

Imagine this – you’re having a really tough day at work, and it’s obvious. Your colleague notices and instead of ignoring it or making a generic statement like “It’ll get better”, they look at you and genuinely ask, “How can I help?”

That happened to me once, and it made a world of difference. The simple act of acknowledging my struggle and offering assistance made me feel seen and valued.

This is a phrase that socially intelligent people use often. It’s about being proactive in showing empathy and willingness to lend a hand. It’s not about trying to fix everything but showing that you’re there, ready to support.

Psychology tells us that offering help not only strengthens relationships but also fosters a positive environment.

When you see someone struggling, don’t hesitate to ask, “How can I help?”

## 3) “Thank you for your patience”

In today’s fast-paced world, patience can often be in short supply. When someone exercises patience, especially during challenging circumstances, it’s a trait that deserves recognition.

Socially intelligent people understand this and express their gratitude for it. The phrase “Thank you for your patience” does not only show your acknowledgement of their patience but also encourages its continuation.

Research in the field of psychology shows that expressing gratitude can positively affect the other person’s mood and behaviour.

Using a simple phrase like “Thank you for your patience” can go a long way in cultivating a positive atmosphere and maintaining harmonious relationships.

## 4) “I respect your perspective”

Disagreements are a natural part of life. However, the way we handle these disagreements can determine the quality of our relationships and interactions.

Socially intelligent people understand this. They know that it’s completely okay to have different viewpoints. In fact, diversity in thoughts and ideas can often lead to better solutions and outcomes.

The phrase “I respect your perspective” is a powerful tool in their arsenal. By saying this, they acknowledge the other person’s viewpoint, even if it’s different from theirs. They create an environment of respect where open and constructive conversation can take place.

It’s not about agreeing with everyone but about respecting differing opinions. And this phrase does just that.

## 5) “I appreciate your input”

Feedback and suggestions can sometimes be hard to take, especially if they’re not in line with our own ideas. But they’re often necessary for growth and improvement.

Socially intelligent people understand the value of feedback. They know that everyone has unique experiences and insights that could be beneficial.

That’s why the phrase “I appreciate your input” is often part of their vocabulary. It shows that they value the other person’s opinion and are open to learning from them.

This phrase encourages others to share their thoughts and ideas, fostering an environment of openness and mutual respect. It’s a phrase that shows appreciation and promotes collaboration.

## 6) “I’m proud of you”

Sometimes, the most powerful things we can say to someone are also the simplest. Telling someone “I’m proud of you” can have a profound impact.

Socially intelligent people understand the power of affirmation. They know that by acknowledging someone’s achievements or efforts, they’re boosting their confidence and encouraging further growth.

The phrase “I’m proud of you” is not just about recognizing results. It’s about appreciating the effort, the journey, and the courage it took to get there. It’s a heartwarming validation that everyone needs to hear now and then.

Don’t hold back these words. Use them sincerely and watch as they uplift and inspire those around you.

## 7) “I made a mistake”

We’re all human, and making mistakes is part of our growth process. I remember a time when I messed up a presentation at work. Instead of making excuses, I admitted, “I made a mistake.”

This phrase is something socially intelligent people aren’t afraid to use. They understand that admitting mistakes doesn’t make them weaker but shows their strength and willingness to learn.

Accepting our errors encourages others to do the same, fostering an environment of transparency and continuous learning. It’s not easy to admit our faults, but when we do, we open the door for growth and improvement.

## 8) “I value your time”

Time is one of the most valuable resources we have. Socially intelligent people understand this and respect others’ time as much as their own.

The phrase “I value your time” is an effective way to communicate this respect. It shows that you acknowledge their time is important and that you won’t take it for granted.

This phrase sets the tone for a productive and efficient interaction, ensuring the other person feels respected and valued. And in turn, it fosters mutual respect and a positive relationship.

## 9) “You matter”

In all our interactions, there’s one thing that socially intelligent people never forget to communicate – the inherent value of the other person.

The phrase “You matter” is possibly the simplest and most powerful way to do this. It conveys respect, appreciation, and the acknowledgment that the other person is important.

This isn’t just about making others feel good. It’s about recognizing their worth and letting them know that they are seen, heard, and valued. Because at the end of the day, we all want to feel that we matter.

## Final thoughts: It’s all about connection

Human interactions are complex and multi-faceted. They’re influenced by a myriad of factors – our upbringing, experiences, and yes, even our brain chemistry.

Social intelligence is about navigating these complexities with grace and empathy. It’s about understanding others, respecting their perspectives, and fostering meaningful connections.

The phrases we’ve discussed are more than just words. They’re tools of connection, expressions of empathy, and catalysts for positive interactions.

Whether it’s saying “I understand…” or “You matter”, each phrase carries weight and potential. They have the power to strengthen relationships, build trust, and create an atmosphere of mutual respect.

So as we go about our daily interactions, let’s remember the power of our words. Let’s strive to be more socially intelligent, not just for ourselves, but for the people we interact with. Because in the end, we’re all in this together.
