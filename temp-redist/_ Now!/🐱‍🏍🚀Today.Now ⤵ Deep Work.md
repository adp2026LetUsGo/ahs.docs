### Develop a 4 Sticky Note Business Plan
I use this exercise in my own companies and also to help other startups get their ideas to the planning stage. Take 4 sticky notes and label them Story, People, Money, and Systems. You can read more about what goes on each sticky note here. This will help you form your first strategic steps to make your idea a reality.
