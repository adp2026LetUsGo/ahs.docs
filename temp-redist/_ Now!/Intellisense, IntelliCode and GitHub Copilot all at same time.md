Sure, let’s break it down:

1. [**IntelliSense**: IntelliSense is a code completion tool that is built into Microsoft Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense)[1](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense). [It provides various code editing features including: code completion, parameter info, quick info, and member lists](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense)[1](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense). [It is a general term for these features which are sometimes called by other names such as “code completion”, “content assist”, and "code hinting"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense)[1](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense). [It supports word based completions for any programming language but can also be configured to have richer IntelliSense by installing a language extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense)[1](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense).
    
2. [**IntelliCode**: IntelliCode is a service that brings AI assistance into your personal development flow](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/intellicode/)[2](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/intellicode/). [It offers whole-line autocompletions, code completion, refactoring, quick actions, and more for C#, Python, and other languages in Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/intellicode/)[2](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/intellicode/). [It uses AI to understand your code context—including variable names, functions, and the type of code you’re writing—to give you the best suggestions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/intellicode/)[2](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/intellicode/).
    
3. [**GitHub Copilot**: GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that provides autocomplete-style suggestions as you code](https://github.blog/2021-06-29-introducing-github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer/)[3](https://github.blog/2021-06-29-introducing-github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer/). [It draws context from the code you’re working on, suggesting whole lines or entire functions](https://github.blog/2021-06-29-introducing-github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer/)[3](https://github.blog/2021-06-29-introducing-github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer/). [It helps you quickly discover alternative ways to solve problems, write tests, and explore new APIs without having to tediously tailor a search for answers on the internet](https://github.blog/2021-06-29-introducing-github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer/)[3](https://github.blog/2021-06-29-introducing-github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer/).
    

When you use all three at the same time, you get a powerful combination of tools that can significantly boost your productivity. IntelliSense provides you with basic code completion and quick information about code elements. IntelliCode enhances this by using AI to provide more context-aware and relevant suggestions. Finally, GitHub Copilot can suggest entire lines or blocks of code, helping you to quickly implement functionality and solve problems. This combination can make the coding process faster, more efficient, and less error-prone.
