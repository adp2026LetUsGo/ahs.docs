The order of designing the following aspects of your emergency alert app depends on your specific needs and requirements. However, here is a suggested order that you can follow:

User experience (UX). The UX of your app is one of the most important aspects, so it is important to start with this.

Think about what your users need and how they will use your app. Make sure that your app is easy to use and navigate, even in an emergency situation.

Data delivery and retrieving. Once you have a good understanding of the UX, you can start to think about how you will deliver and retrieve data for your app. This includes things like the type of data you will need, the frequency with which you will need to update the data, and the way in which you will store and secure the data.

SMS and communications. How will users be notified of emergencies? Will you use SMS, push notifications, or a combination of both? How will you communicate with users during an emergency?

Maps. If your app will use maps, you will need to decide which map provider you will use and how you will integrate the maps into your app.

Other features. There are many other features that you may want to include in your emergency alert app, such as the ability to share alerts with others, the ability to report emergencies, and the ability to access emergency resources.

It is important to note that this is just a suggested order. The specific order of designing the aspects of your app will depend on your specific needs and requirements. It is also important to iterate on your design and make changes as needed.

Here are some additional tips for designing an emergency alert app:

Make sure your app is easy to use in an emergency situation. Users should be able to quickly and easily find the information they need, even if they are panicking.

Use clear and concise language.

Users should be able to understand the alerts and instructions that your app provides.

Make sure your app is accessible to everyone.

This includes people with disabilities and people who speak different languages.

Test your app with real users.

Get feedback from users to see how they like your app and what they would like to see improved.

Keep your app updated.

As you learn more about emergencies and the needs of your users, you may need to make changes to your app.

Make sure to keep your app updated with new features and bug fixes.
