In the context of the **Google Antigravity IDE**, "antigravity structure folders" refers to ==the specific directory hierarchy used by the system to manage autonomous agents, skills, and project workflows==.

As a heavily modified fork of Visual Studio Code, Antigravity prioritizes an "agent-first" architecture where files are organized to support multi-agent orchestration. 

The Antigravity IDE uses specific hidden directories to define how agents interact with your code: 

- `.agent/skills/`: This is the primary location for project-specific skills. These are scripts and instructions (often in Markdown or YAML) that agents use to perform tasks like deployment or code refactoring.
- `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/`: This is the global scope folder for skills available across all your projects on the machine, such as universal formatting tools or code style reviewers.
- `.agent/workflows/`: A folder used to store workflow definition files (e.g., `test-workflow.md`) that guide the agent through multi-step automation processes.
- `BLUEPRINT.md ~~PROJECT_SPEC.md~~`: Often found in the root, this file serves as the initial blueprint from which Antigravity generates task lists and folder hierarchies. 

Key folder management features include:

- Agent Manager View: Antigravity often hides the standard file tree by default, replacing it with an Agent Manager dashboard to monitor parallel tasks.
- Multi-Root Workspaces: It supports multi-root workspaces similar to VS Code, allowing agents to access and modify disparate folders simultaneously.
- Automated Organization: An agent can restructure messy folders (e.g., `/Downloads`) by content analysis. It will generate a "Move Plan" artifact before physically moving files into new directories.
