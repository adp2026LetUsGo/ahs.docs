in principle what does SKILL.md contains, give me examples

In principle, the `SKILL.md` file serves as the **"brain" or "Employee Handbook"** for a specific task within the Google Antigravity IDE. It uses a "Progressive Disclosure" pattern to save on token costs: the IDE only reads the name and description at first, only "hydrating" the full instructions if the task is relevant. 

Core Components of `SKILL.md`

1. **YAML Frontmatter (Metadata)**: This defines the skill for the system. It must include a **unique name** and a **detailed description** that acts as the "semantic trigger" for the agent.
2. **Markdown Body (Instructions)**: This provides the step-by-step logic, specific conventions, and constraints (the "How-To") the agent must follow.
3. **Tool/Script References**: Explicit instructions on how to use any accompanying scripts in the `scripts/` folder, including which flags or arguments to pass.

Examples of `SKILL.md` Content

Example 1: Git Commit Formatter

This skill ensures the agent always follows project-specific commit standards. 

yaml

```
---
name: git-commit-formatter
description: Formats Git commit messages using the Conventional Commits standard. Use when the user asks to commit changes.
---
# Git Commit Formatter
When generating a commit message, follow these rules:
1. **Analyze**: Review the staged diff to identify the primary change.
2. **Type**: Use types like `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, or `refactor`.
3. **Format**: Write in the imperative mood (e.g., "add login" not "added login").
4. **Action**: Propose the full command: `git commit -m "<type>: <description>"`
```

Use code with caution.

Example 2: Deployment Safety Check

This skill prevents accidental production deployments if staging is unhealthy.

yaml

```
---
name: ops-safety
description: Checks staging environment health before allowing production deployment.
---
# Ops Safety Skill
Before performing any deployment tasks:
1. Run the local script `./scripts/check_staging.sh`.
2. If the script output is "Red", **abort** and report the error logs to the user.
3. If "Green", proceed with the deployment using `forge deploy -e production`.
```

Use code with caution.

Example 3: License Header Adder

This skill demonstrates how an agent uses the `resources/` folder. 

yaml

```
---
name: license-header-adder
description: Adds the standard legal license header to new source files.
---
# License Header Skill
When a new file is created:
1. Read the template from `./resources/HEADER_TEMPLATE.txt`.
2. Detect the file extension (e.g., `.py`, `.js`).
3. Prepend the template text using the correct comment syntax for that language.
```

Use code with caution.
