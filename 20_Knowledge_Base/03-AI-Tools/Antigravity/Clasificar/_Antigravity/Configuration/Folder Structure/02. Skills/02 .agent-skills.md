.agent/skills/

Files in the `.agent/skills/` directory are ==**modular instruction sets** and **executable tools** that extend the Google Antigravity agent's capabilities==. Unlike static rules, these are "ephemeral task definitions"—the agent only loads them when it detects they are relevant to your current task, saving memory and processing power. 

Structure of a Skill Folder

A skill is not a single file, but a subfolder within `.agent/skills/` (e.g., `.agent/skills/my-custom-skill/`) containing: 

- **`SKILL.md` (Required):** The "brain" of the skill. It uses **YAML frontmatter** for metadata (name, description, triggers) and **Markdown** for detailed instructions.
- **`scripts/` (Optional):** Contains local Python, Bash, or Node.js scripts that the agent can execute to perform actions like running a specific build pipeline.
- **`resources/` (Optional):** Stores templates, documentation snippets, or reference code the agent should use as a model. 

Examples of Skills

Depending on your project, you might place these types of skills in the folder:

- **`git-commit-formatter`**: Automatically triggered when you ask the agent to "Commit these changes." It enforces **Conventional Commits** standards and analyzes your diff to write the message.
- **`ops-safety`**: Used for deployment checks. It might contain a script that pings your monitoring API (like Datadog) to ensure "Staging" is healthy before allowing a merge.
- **`database-migration-guide`**: Loaded only when the agent detects a change to a schema file. It provides the specific SQL patterns and safety protocols for your project's database.
- **`testing-enforcer`**: A skill that knows how to run your project's unique test suite (e.g., specialized `pytest` or `vitest` flags) and how to interpret the specific error logs produced.
- **`license-header-adder`**: A simple utility that scans new files and applies the correct legal header templates from the `resources/` folder. 

Key Differences: Workspace vs. Global 

- **Workspace (`.agent/skills/`)**: These skills are project-specific. When a repository is cloned, these skills are included to ensure all developers' agents follow the same project protocols.
- **Global (`~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/`)**: These are "personal superpowers" that are available across all projects, such as a **JSON Formatter** or **README Optimizer**.
