No worries, it's easy to get turned around with these hidden folders! You have two choices depending on where you want the "power" to live:

#### 1. The Project-Specific Way (Recommended)

If you want this skill to work **only** for the specific C# project you are currently working on, create it here:

> `YourProjectRoot/.agent/skills/dotnet-service-generator/SKILL.md`

- **Why?** This is best for team projects. When you push your code to Git, the skill goes with it, so your teammates' agents can use it too.

#### 2. The Global Way

If you want this skill to be available in **every** .NET project you open on your computer, create it here:

`~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/dotnet-service-generator/SKILL.md`

- **Note:** On Windows, `~` usually refers to `C:\Users\YourName\`.
- **Why?** This is best for your personal preferences, like a "Personal C# Code Style" skill that you want everywhere.

💡 Quick Tip to get started:

1. Open your project in the **Antigravity IDE**.
2. Open the integrated terminal.
3. Run this command to create the folder structure instantly:
    
    
    
    ``` bash
   mkdir -p .agent/skills/dotnet-service-generator/scripts
   ```
    
    Use code with caution.
    
4. Create a new file in that folder named `SKILL.md` and paste your .NET 10 instructions there.
