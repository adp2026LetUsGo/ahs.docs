scripts/ and resources/ are optional subfolders of .agent/skills/?

Yes, they are **optional**. A functional Google Antigravity skill only strictly requires a `SKILL.md` file to exist within its subfolder. 

The `scripts/` and `resources/` (sometimes also called `assets/` or `references/`) subfolders are used to provide the agent with additional tools and context beyond text instructions. 

Optional Subfolder Breakdown

- **`scripts/`**: Contains executable code that the agent can run as a "black box".
    - **Languages:** Support for Python, Bash, Node.js, or Go.
    - **Usage:** Instead of the agent trying to "hallucinate" complex logic, it simply executes these scripts and reads the output.
    - **Example:** A script named `check_staging.sh` that returns a "Green" or "Red" status signal.
- **`resources/` (or `references/`)**: Contains static files the agent should reference while working.
    - **Content:** Templates, style guides, documentation snippets, or configuration examples.
    - **Usage:** This prevents "context window bloat" because the agent only reads these files if they are specifically needed for a task.
    - **Example:** A `PR_TEMPLATE.md` that the agent should follow when drafting pull requests. 

Minimal vs. Full Structure

A **minimal** skill might look like this:

text

```
.agent/skills/git-helper/
└── SKILL.md (Instructions only)
```

Use code with caution.

A **full-featured** skill would look like this:

text

```
.agent/skills/security-auditor/
├── SKILL.md (Instructions and metadata)
├── scripts/
│   └── run_scanner.py (Python script to run a security scan)
└── resources/
    └── owasp_cheatsheet.txt (Reference guide for the agent)
```

Use code with caution.

Would you like to see a **template** for a `SKILL.md` file to see how it links to these folders?
