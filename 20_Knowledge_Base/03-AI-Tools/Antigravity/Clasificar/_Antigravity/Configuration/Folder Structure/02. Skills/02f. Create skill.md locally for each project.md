Smart move. Keeping them **local** (project-specific) ensures your agent won't accidentally try to apply **Web API** patterns to a **MAUI** project, or mix up different architectural rules between your apps.

Once you have created your `.agent/skills/` folders in both projects, you can verify they are active by asking the **Antigravity Chat**:

> _"What skills do you have available in this project?"_

Pro-Tip for Multi-Project Workflows:

If Project A uses **Clean Architecture** and Project B uses **Minimal APIs**, your `SKILL.md` descriptions should be very specific:

- **In Project A (`.agent/skills/clean-gen/SKILL.md`)**:  
    `description: Use this to generate boilerplate for the Domain and Infrastructure layers of this Clean Architecture project.`
- **In Project B (`.agent/skills/minimal-gen/SKILL.md`)**:  
    `description: Use this to scaffold new endpoints directly into the Program.cs file for this Minimal API project.`

The agent is smart enough to "see" only the skills in the current active folder you have open in the Antigravity IDE.

Would you like a specific **Minimal API** `.NET 10` template for Project B to get you started, or are you ready to start building the `SKILL.md` files?
