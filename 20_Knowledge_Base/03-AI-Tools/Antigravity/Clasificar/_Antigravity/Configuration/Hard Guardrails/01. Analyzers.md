## ✅ Why Analyzers are Mandatory for Native AOT

When you target Native AOT in .NET 10, your biggest enemies are **Reflection** and **Dynamic Code Generation**. If your AI agent (in Antigravity or Cursor) writes code that isn't "trim-compatible," your app will fail.

In .NET 10, you should use the built-in **AOT Analyzers** instead of old FXCop rules. They catch:

- **IsTrimmable:** Ensures your code doesn't pull in 50MB of unused libraries.
    
- **RequiresUnreferencedCode:** Flags methods that use reflection which AOT cannot see.
    
- **RequiresDynamicCode:** Flags code that tries to compile new code at runtime (which is impossible in AOT).

## 🛠️ The Modern .NET 10 / Antigravity Stack

Since you are using **.slnx** solutions and .NET 10, here is the setup that replaces FXCop/StyleCop while supporting your AI-driven workflow:

### 1. Enable AOT Analysis in your `.csproj`

Instead of an external tool, you bake the requirements into the project. This forces the AI agents in Antigravity to respect AOT constraints.

XML

```
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>
  <PublishAot>true</PublishAot>
  <EnableTrimAnalyzer>true</EnableTrimAnalyzer>
  <EnableAotAnalyzer>true</EnableAotAnalyzer>
  <AnalysisMode>All</AnalysisMode> 
</PropertyGroup>
```

### 2. Use `EditorConfig` for Style

Forget the StyleCop extension. .NET 10 uses `.editorconfig` to enforce style. Antigravity will read this file and ensure the code it generates matches your specific formatting rules (indentation, naming, etc.).

### 3. Roslyn Analyzers (The Modern "StyleCop")

If you want the strict rule enforcement StyleCop used to provide, use the **StyleCop.Analyzers** NuGet package. It integrates directly into the compiler, meaning:

- Errors show up in your `.slnx` in real-time.
    
- The AI can "see" the squiggly lines and fix them automatically.

## 💡 Summary for your Antigravity Projects

|**Aspect**|**Old Tool**|**.NET 10 / AOT Replacement**|
|---|---|---|
|**Code Quality**|FXCop|`Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers` (Built-in)|
|**AOT Safety**|None|`EnableAotAnalyzer` (Mandatory for AOT)|
|**Code Style**|StyleCop|`.editorconfig` + `StyleCop.Analyzers` (NuGet)|
|**IDE Integration**|Manual Run|Real-time in Antigravity / `.slnx`|

By using the modern Analyzers, you provide the "guardrails" that Gemini 3 needs to write high-performance, AOT-compatible code without the overhead of legacy tools.

**Would you like me to generate a standard `.editorconfig` optimized for C# 14 / .NET 10 that you can drop into your Antigravity workspace?**
