I have claude and ChatGPT, can i use this tools to consult about Google Antigravity Coding Tool?

Absolutely! You can definitely use Claude and ChatGPT to consult about the **Google Antigravity Coding Tool**. Since Antigravity was launched in November 2025 and is built on the familiar **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** foundation, most modern AI models have a solid understanding of its architecture, even if their training data has slight gaps on the very latest 2026 updates.

Here is how you can best leverage each tool for your "Google Antigravity" projects:

## 🛠️ How to Consult Each Tool

### 1. Using Claude (Anthropic)

Claude is particularly strong at **architectural planning** and **complex debugging**. Since Antigravity uses an "Agent Manager" to handle multiple tasks, Claude can help you write the high-level "Implementation Plans" that Antigravity agents require.

- **Best for:** Writing precise system prompts for Antigravity agents.
    
- **Tip:** If you are using **.NET 10** (your preferred framework), Claude is excellent at generating the clean, boilerplate-free code that Antigravity agents can then execute in the IDE.
    

### 2. Using ChatGPT (OpenAI)

ChatGPT (especially models like **GPT-5.1 Codex** or the **o1/o2 series**) is highly reliable for **generating diffs** and **refactoring logic**.

- **Best for:** Troubleshooting specific errors you see in the Antigravity terminal.
    
- **Tip:** You can paste the "Artifacts" (like Task Lists or Browser Recordings logs) from Antigravity into ChatGPT to get a second opinion on why an agent might be failing a UI test.

## 💡 Comparison: Antigravity vs. The Others

|Feature|Google Antigravity|Claude / ChatGPT|
|---|---|---|
|**Execution**|**Can run code** and control the browser.|Primarily text/code generation.|
|**Interface**|"Mission Control" (Multi-agent).|Chat-based or CLI-based.|
|**Context**|Deep integration with your local files.|Requires you to paste code (unless using specialized extensions).|
|**Best Use**|**Action:** Doing the actual work.|**Consultation:** Planning and explaining.|

## 🚀 Pro-Tip for your Workflow

Since you are working within the **Google Antigravity** environment, remember that it is an **agentic IDE**. This means you don't just "chat" with it—you manage it.

- **Step 1:** Use **Claude** to design a complex .NET 10 architecture.
    
- **Step 2:** Feed that design into the **Antigravity Agent Manager** as a "Mission."
    
- **Step 3:** If the agent gets stuck, copy the error log into **ChatGPT** for a quick fix, then give the fix back to the Antigravity agent.
    

**Note:** Since you mentioned the shift to `.slnx` files (the new XML-based solution format), make sure to tell Claude or ChatGPT: _"I am using the new .slnx solution format in .NET 10,"_ as their training might still default to the older `.sln` format.
