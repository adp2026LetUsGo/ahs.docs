# AI Vault — Home

Welcome! This vault organizes **AI knowledge** across foundations, LLMs, engineering, tools, development, use cases, research, datasets, glossary, templates, and an inbox for quick capture.

> [!tip] How to use this vault
> - Start at a Map of Content (MOC) and drill down.
> - Use the **Inbox** for quick notes; periodically refactor into the right section.
> - Keep notes short and focused; link liberally.
