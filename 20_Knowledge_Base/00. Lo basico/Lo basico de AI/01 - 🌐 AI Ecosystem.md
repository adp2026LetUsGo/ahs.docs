# 🧠 **Explanation (High‑Level C4 View)**

_(English, concise and aligned to your architecture mindset)_

## **1. Foundation Models (LLM Layer)**

The cognitive engine: GPT‑4.5, o3, Claude 3.7, Gemini, Llama.  
They provide reasoning, code generation, language understanding.

## **2. Agents (Autonomy Layer)**

Agents turn raw intelligence into _action_:

- Cursor’s Agent Mode
- GitHub Copilot Agents
- Claude Agents
- Windsurf Cascade agent

Agents can plan, execute, iterate, and self‑correct.

## **3. Skills (Portable Capability Layer)**

Your favorite part: **the new industry standard**.

Skills are:

- Portable
- Deterministic
- Vendor‑neutral
- Reusable across platforms (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Cursor, VS Code)

They encode procedural knowledge: workflows, scripts, constraints, domain rules.

## **4. Tools / Actions (Execution Layer)**

Agents and Skills use tools to act on the real world:

- APIs
- MCP servers
- Web browsing
- Python execution
- File operations
- SQL access
- Local system commands

This is where your systems like AHS.FinTechBook interact with the environment.

## **5. Context & Memory (Knowledge Layer)**

Agents become **enterprise‑aware** through:

- Files, documents
- Organizational knowledge
- People Skills
- User profiles
- Embeddings or vectors
- Long‑term memory

This grounding is essential for reliable behavior.

## **6. Applications (Your Domain Layer)**

Finally, agents + skills + tools support real solutions:

- AHS.FinTechBook
- AHS.MicroSaaS platforms
- Billing, invoicing, accounting
- Data pipelines
- Dashboards, automation flows

This is where your entire architecture benefits directly.
