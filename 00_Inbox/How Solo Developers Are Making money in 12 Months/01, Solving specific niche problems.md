Solo developers are earning money with Micro-SaaS by solving specific niche problems, achieving profitability within 12 months, and leveraging low-cost tools and focused marketing strategies. While most Micro-SaaS businesses make under $1,000 per month, there are numerous examples of solo founders reaching five and six-figure monthly revenues by addressing a clear pain point for their audience. 

Core strategies for solo Micro-SaaS success

- **Focus on a niche problem:** Instead of building a broad, all-in-one product like a traditional SaaS, Micro-SaaS founders target a small, specific group of people with an acute problem. For example, Carrd focused on building simple, one-page websites for people who don't need a complex site builder.
- **Rapid development and validation:** Instead of spending months building in secret, many solo developers build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in a few weeks and get it in front of potential customers quickly to validate the idea. Some even use no-code tools and simple landing pages to test traction before writing code.
- **Bootstrap funding and low overhead:** Most Micro-SaaS companies are bootstrapped, meaning they rely on their own funds instead of outside investment. With minimal overhead, they can achieve high profit margins, sometimes exceeding 80%.
- **Recurring revenue models:** A subscription-based model is key to creating a predictable and steady income stream. Founders often use tiered pricing or freemium models to cater to different user needs.
- **Audience-first marketing:** Solo developers market their products by engaging with their target audience in online communities, like forums and social media groups, and building in public. This builds trust and generates word-of-mouth referrals.
