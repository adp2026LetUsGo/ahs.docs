[Publishing your Shopify app involves a few steps](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web)[1](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web)[2](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/how-to-build-a-shopify-app)[3](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/review/app-submission):

1. [**Set up hosting**: To make your app available to Shopify and to app users, you need to host it](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web)[1](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web). [You can host your app using any service or platform you prefer](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web)[1](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web). [In the tutorial provided by Shopify, they use Fly.io and Heroku as examples](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web)[1](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web).
    
2. [**Retrieve environment variables**: Apps created using Shopify CLI use environment variables for configuration](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web)[1](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web). [During local development, Shopify CLI provides the environment variables directly to the environment](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web)[1](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web). [However, to deploy your app, you need to retrieve these variables for your app so you can set them in a later step](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web)[1](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web).
    
3. [**Meet Shopify’s app requirements**: There are technical, security, and UX requirements that all public apps must meet before they can be approved for the app store](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web)[2](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/how-to-build-a-shopify-app). [Follow these requirements as you build and prepare to submit your app to ensure your app is published without hiccups](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web)[2](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/how-to-build-a-shopify-app).
    
4. [**Submit your app for review**: Log in to your Partner Dashboard](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web)[3](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/review/app-submission). [Click Apps](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web)[3](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/review/app-submission). [Click the name of your app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web)[3](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/review/app-submission). [Click Distribution](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web)[3](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/review/app-submission). [If you haven’t selected a distribution method yet, then select Public distribution, and click Confirm](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/review/app-submission)[3](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/review/app-submission). [Click Create listing or Manage listing](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web)[3](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/review/app-submission).
    

Remember, the review process can take some time, so be patient. Once your app is approved, it will be available in the Shopify App Store for merchants to install and use. Good luck! 🚀
