1. [**Define the Purpose and Features**: Identify the key functionalities you want in your app](https://www.hulkapps.com/blogs/shopify-hub/how-to-create-an-app-for-your-shopify-store-a-step-by-step-guide)[3](https://www.hulkapps.com/blogs/shopify-hub/how-to-create-an-app-for-your-shopify-store-a-step-by-step-guide).

2. [**Set up your development environment**: You’ll need to have a Partner account and a development store](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create)[1](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create). [You’ll also need to have Node.js 18 or higher, a Node.js package manager (either npm, Yarn 1.x, or pnpm), and Git 2.28.0 or higher installed](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create)[1](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create).
    
3. [**Create a new app**: Navigate to the directory where you want to create your app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create)[1](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create). [Your app will be created in a new subdirectory](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create)[1](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create). [Run one of the following commands to create a new app: `npm init @shopify/app@latest`](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create)[1](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create). [When prompted, enter a name for your app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create)[1](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create).
    
4. [**Start a local development server**: After your app is created, you can work with it using a local development server and the Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create)[1](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create). [Shopify CLI uses Cloudflare to create a tunnel that enables your app to be accessed using a HTTPS URL](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create)[1](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create).
    
5. [**Install your app on your development store**: You can install your app on your development store, and automatically populate your development store with products that you can use for app testing](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create)[1](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create).
    
6. [**Submit your app for approval**: If your app meets Shopify’s requirements, you can start selling it in the Shopify App Store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/making-apps)[2](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/making-apps).
